Level format
------------

* each level file is a simple text file
* it has 15 (6+9) lines
* first 6 lines are definitions of the snakes
  - if you don't want to use all 6 snakes just use '-' to ignore the snake
  - snake definition looks like this:
    - position of the snake (row and column, two numbers, each 1-9)
    - orientation of the snake (one number, 0-5, 0 is down, 1 is left-down, etc.)
    - shape of the snake
      - every snake starts with a head (H) and ends with a tail (T)
      - between them you can insert the following parts:
        - S - straight part
        - l - slow turn left
        - L - sharp turn left
        - r - slow turn left
        - R - sharp turn left
* the next 9 lines are definition of the board
  - '.' means the cell is usable
  - 'X' means the cell is missing (unusable for play)
